<b>Lyrics that hit hard:</b><br>
<em>Ha-ha<br>
Watch the news 'bout them new follow rules<br>
Lead to fools, couple issues<br>
Every day 'cause we programmed<br>
They all pick what we choose<br>
All the same who is who<br>
Everything that we do, we program (ayy)<br>
Watch the news 'bout them new follow rules<br>
Lead to fools, couple issues (look, ayy-ayy)<br>
Every day 'cause we programmed<br>
They all pick what we choose<br>
All the same who is who<br>
Everything that we do, we program<br>
Look, they won't explain why still we have the same thoughts<br>
Say the wrong thing, and they'll put us in the same box<br>
One world, one currency and no God<br>
I won't let them piss on me and tell me that it's rain drops<br>
Lies where they sellin' at<br>
Truth, they don't tell us that<br>
I don't care if you're a republican or a democrat<br>
I hear what you're tellin' me<br>
We are not the enemy<br>
They pushin' their narrative through these Hollywood celebrities<br>
We livin' in the matrix<br>
Every day the same shit<br>
You don't like the history, you just try to erase it<br>
You don't like somethin' or somebody, you replace it<br>
Everything is sexist, everything is racist<br>
Every claim is baseless, everything is tainted<br>
I let my life would be like the American Dream, it's so tasteless<br>
Time that we face it, I don't fear no man<br>
Why you think they've been callin' these TV shows programs?<br>
Watch the news 'bout them new follow rules<br>
Lead to fools, couple issues<br>
Every day 'cause we programmed<br>
They all pick what we choose<br>
All the same who is who<br>
Everything that we do, we program<br>
Watch the news 'bout them new follow rules<br>
Lead to fools, couple issues<br>
Every day 'cause we programmed<br>
They all pick what we choose<br>
All the same who is who<br>
Everything that we do, we program<br>
Ayy, capitalism, got us trapped in a prison<br>
Killin' people over Jordan's while they laughin' and chillin'<br>
The liquor store ain't fast food, gotcha in a bad mood<br>
A-all lives prolly the size, don't really value<br>
Criminals like the citizens<br>
Killin' all of the witnesses<br>
What type of bullshit is this? The world that we livin' in<br>
There's an app to find love<br>
There's an app to buy drugs<br>
There's no app to find us<br>
While they sprayin' our crops<br>
They want you hatin' the cops<br>
They want you hatin' your moms<br>
They want you hatin' your pops<br>
Want us hatin' each other, that's how they divide and conquer<br>
Sell your soul if you want an easy way to the top<br>
I've been prayin' to God<br>
I know he hearin' the call<br>
They just playin' your emotions, gotcha fearin' it all<br>
It's love over here, not that fake stuff neither<br>
I'll deprogram myself, I don't need ya<br>
Watch the news 'bout them new follow rules<br>
Lead to fools, couple issues<br>
Every day 'cause we programmed<br>
They all pick what we choose<br>
All the same who is who<br>
Everything that we do, we program<br>
Watch the news 'bout them new follow rules<br>
Lead to fools, couple issues<br>
Every day 'cause we programmed<br>
They all pick what we choose<br>
All the same who is who<br>
Everything that we do, we program<br>
You and I are told increasingly we have to choose between a left or right<br>
Well, I'd like to suggest there is no such thing as a left or right<br>
There is only an up or down<br>
In this present crisis, government is not the solution to our problem<br>
Government is the problem<br></em>
